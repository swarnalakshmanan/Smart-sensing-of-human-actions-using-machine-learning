Abstract:
      Sensing of Human activity using smartphones which provides the basic movements like walking ,sitting,standing,lying,etc...
      We will use data collected from accelerometer & gyrometer sensors. 
      Virtually every modern smartphone has a tri-axial accelerometer that measures acceleration in all three spatial dimensions. 
      Additionally, accelerometers can detect device orientation.
